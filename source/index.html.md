# Pepper ChatBot API


```satisfi
"Satisfi is the default bot used by our Pepper API. If a user doesn’t 
hash their company with a different bot, they are allowed to use and 
train our Satisfi bot with Utterances and Responses as they wish. "
```

```msbot
"Microsoft's open source Bot Builder SDKs allow you to build simple
to sophisticated dialogs; Cognitive Services enable your bot to see,
hear, interpret and interact in more human ways. Ms-Bot is the first,
3rd-party ChatBot integration that SoftBank Robotics supports."
```

Welcome to the Pepper ChatBot API! You can use this API to access a 3rd party chatbot's endpoints in order to integrate an existing chatbot with Pepper. 

You can view general integration instructions in this central, light blue section. In the dark area to the right, you can see chatbot-specific code examples corresponding visually in line with each general section. Switch between different chatbot-specific code examples with the tabs in the top right.

<aside class="notice">We currently only support integrations with our default chatbot service (satisfi) and the Microsoft Bot Framework (msbot), but this list is quickly growing, so check back soon or else get in touch with us directly if your chatbot platform does not appear on this list!</aside>


# Authentication


```msbot
"Provide your 'botToken' to the SoftBank Robotics Sales Engineer assisting you with setup. 
You can find your 'botToken' by following these steps:
Step 1: Open your bot in Azure portal
Step 2: Select the CHANNELS tab
Step 3: Add DirectLine to your bot
Step 4: Click on Edit
Step 5: Copy one of the Secret Keys that was generated; this is your botToken"

"To see a working example, download the emulator and follow the instructions here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator,

using the following sample PuppyBot information to set up your emulator:"

MS Bot Endpoint:

"https://pepper-msbot.azurewebsites.net/api/messages?code=e3fa60oaOlabQUptT63DYSWPxrdG0pS9zFrADLT1xX9iGx6FxAG7pw=="

PuppyBot App Id

"808ad83e-3876-40fd-b0e8-a616e014fc6f"

PuppyBot Password

"9nHp8QNcwQJcNDHHjBCnoj7"

PuppyBot LUIS Endpoint:

"https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/4e4b1c46-5d6d-4035-9905-eef921df734f?subscription-key=37e463e0ae22427abc606d076dafbdd3&timezoneOffset=-480&verbose=true&spellCheck=true&q="
```
ChatBots use RESTful APIs with APP IDs, PASSWORDs, and/or ACCESS TOKENS to authenticate in order to retrieve chatbot data. Requests are made to the ChatBot from a single endpoint:

<code>https://{YOUR-CHATBOT'S-ENDPOINT}</code>

<aside class="notice">Authorization: Varies between chatbots, but typically requires your App ID and Password when configuring. We currently must work together with your   developers to set this up, but will soon provide a web interface for self service.</aside>


# Pepper Data Model

> Pepper Data Model - Pepper API returns the following data model, with its variations, in reply to an utterance or wav file sent through either POST or Websocket:

```json
{ 
    "utteranceId": GUID,
    "sessionId": GUID,
    "botConversationId": GUID,
    "speak": STRING,
    "show": {
       "text": STRING,
        "content": [{
            "text": STRING,
            "speak": STRING,
            "contentURL": STRING URL,
            "value": STRING
        }]
    }
}
```

To the right, you can see the generic data model returned by the Pepper API. Below you can find definitions for the various datums returned in the response. In the sections that follow, you can see precisely how Pepper will display various types of mixed media responses.


### Definitions:

<code> utteranceId</code>

A GUID generated by Pepper in order to track the sent and returned values for an utterance.

<code> sessionId </code>

A GUID generated by Pepper in order to track the chat session, has a mapping to a botCoversationId if needed.

<code> botConversationId </code>

A GUID generated by the bot in the cloud. Satisfi let’s us set this, so it’s a one to one mapping in some cases.

<code> speak </code>

A string Pepper is meant to speak upon RETURN of the data model from the WebSocket

<code> show </code>

An object detailing out what Pepper is supposed to show, along with actionable entities

<code> show.text </code>

A string that Pepper is supposed to show as a title for the content to be displayed

<code> show.content </code>

A object that contains an array of objects meant to cover all scenarios related to chatbot interfaces.

<code> show.content.text </code>

A nullable string to be shown for the content object

<code> show.content.speak </code>

A nullable string for Pepper to speak upon selection of the content object

<code> show.content.contentURL </code>

The nullable url for the content to be displayed of the content object

<code> show.content.value </code>

A nullable string that contains the actionable value to be returned to the chat bot upon content selection.
